%\textbf{Intended Learning Outcomes:} at the end of this workshop you should have acquired basic competence with using OpenSesame, and you should be able to use the available OpenSesame-specific documentation, online tutorials, and online forums to build upon that basic competence.
%I think that most beginners should be able to reach a point where they can create a simple stimulus-response experiment from scratch, having had no previous experience.
%I think that most of those people would also be able to reach a point where they can take a more complicated template experiment, and adjust it until it produces the behaviour required for, say, a final year project experiment.
