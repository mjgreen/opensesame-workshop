OpenSesame is a free piece of drag'n'drop software for creating computer-based experiments in psychology. You are being offered an optional 2-hour hands-on workshop explaining how to use OpenSesame to create experiments, with a focus on templates for tasks that are used most commonly in student projects. 

This 2-hour workshop is being run twice in week 18 (same content each time): Wednesday 6th November 5-7pm in P105 and Thursday 7th November 9-11am in P105. Attendance is optional, and it's first-come-first-served so there is no signing up. 

The workshop is aimed at complete beginners: no previous knowledge of OpenSesame itself is assumed, nor is any previous knowledge of any other experiment-running software assumed, nor is any experience writing code assumed.

You would benefit from attending if you will be running a computer-based stimulus-response experiment for your project (so if you are doing a survey-based or observational project instead, then you would not benefit from attending).

The format of the workshop is such that some of the content will be presented in traditional lecture-style, other parts will be demonstrations of experiments running in real time on the big screen, along with explanations of how OpenSesame made that particular experiment happen -- but most importantly there will also be hands-on exercises that you'll carry out yourself using the computers in the room or laptops you bring with you, and where I will walk round and give you some individual advice and explanation.

If you want to come along at the start just to see what it's like, you're welcome to do that, and if you decide that it's not for you, you can leave any time and there will be no hard feelings - same if you can only come for part of the 2 hours and need to arrive late or leave early.
